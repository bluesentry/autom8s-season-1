# Goal

Focus on `Build Performance Optimization` within the context of "challenge" project.

_Outline_
- Identify slow steps in the pipeline.
- Detect repetitive long-running jobs.
- Suggest caching strategies (e.g., Docker layer caching, artifact reuse).
- Optimize compute resource allocation for efficiency.

_Grading_
- Technical Innovation (30%): How novel and effective is the AI/ML integration?
- Accuracy & Effectiveness (25%): How well does the solution identify issues and suggest fixes?
- Usability & Presentation (20%): Clarity of output, dashboard quality, and ease of use.
- Cost & Performance Impact (15%): Measured improvements and cloud cost considerations.
- Demo & Communication (10%): Effectiveness of final presentation and ability to explain the solution.

## Repo Structure

### Projects
Projects contain standalone, executable code that can be run independently of other projects. They are typically used to demonstrate a specific feature or functionality

### Libraries
Libraries contain reusable code that can be imported and used by other projects. They are typically used to provide common functionality or utilities that can be shared across multiple projects.
